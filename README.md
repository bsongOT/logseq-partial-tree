# Partial Tree as Logseq Plugin

This plugin is useful when you want to organize pages.

Of course, the page relationship is graph-based,

But I think the graph is too esoteric for us to browse pages with our eyes.

So I created this plugin.

## Demo \[Will be added\]

## Features

- You can view or hide page sublink pages. (toggle tool)

- You can leave a visit flag. (flag tool)

- You can view or hide layer that means what connection it is. (setting visiblity)

- You can open any page with Shift + Click.
